# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 brings exciting new features and improvements that make building modern web applications even more powerful and efficient. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key features and help you get started with your first Next.js 14 project.

## What's New in Next.js 14

Next.js 14 introduces several groundbreaking features:

### 1. Turbopack (Beta)
Turbopack is the new Rust-based bundler that's up to 700x faster than Webpack for local development.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev -- --turbo
```

### 2. Server Actions (Stable)
Server Actions provide a seamless way to handle server-side logic directly in your React components.

```typescript
async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  'use server'
  
  const title = formData.get('title') as string
  const content = formData.get('content') as string
  
  // Save to database
  await db.post.create({
    data: { title, content }
  })
}

export default function CreatePost() {
  return (
    <form action={createPost}>
      <input name="title" placeholder="Post title" />
      <textarea name="content" placeholder="Post content" />
      <button type="submit">Create Post</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

### 3. Partial Prerendering (Preview)
This experimental feature combines the benefits of static and dynamic rendering.

## Setting Up Your First Project

Let's create a new Next.js 14 project from scratch:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app
```

This command creates a new project with:
- TypeScript support
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ESLint for code quality
- App Router (recommended)

## Project Structure

Your new Next.js 14 project will have this structure:

```
my-nextjs-app/
├── app/
│   ├── globals.css
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── page.tsx
├── public/
├── next.config.js
├── package.json
└── tailwind.config.ts
```

## Key Concepts

### App Router
The App Router is built on React Server Components and supports:
- Nested layouts
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Parallel routes

### Server Components vs Client Components
- **Server Components**: Render on the server, great for data fetching
- **Client Components**: Render on the client, needed for interactivity

## Best Practices

1. **Use Server Components by default**: Only use Client Components when you need interactivity
2. **Optimize images**: Use the `next/image` component for automatic optimization
3. **Implement proper SEO**: Use metadata API for better search engine optimization
4. **Follow the file-based routing**: Organize your routes using the file system

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 represents a significant step forward in web development, offering improved performance, better developer experience, and powerful new features. Whether you're building a simple blog or a complex web application, Next.js 14 provides the tools you need to succeed.
