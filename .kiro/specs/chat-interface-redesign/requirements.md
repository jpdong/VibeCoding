# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for redesigning the ChatInterface component to provide a world-class, professional, and clean AI conversation experience. The new design will incorporate modern AI chat interface patterns with model selection capabilities, improved user experience, and enhanced visual design that aligns with contemporary AI assistant interfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Vibe Coding, I want a modern and intuitive chat interface, so that I can easily interact with the AI assistant and get coding help efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loads the chat interface THEN the system SHALL display a clean, modern layout with clear visual hierarchy
2. WHEN the user views the interface THEN the system SHALL provide visual elements that are consistent with modern AI chat applications
3. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL respond with smooth animations and transitions
4. WHEN the user accesses the interface on different devices THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive design that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select different AI models for my conversations, so that I can choose the most appropriate model for my specific coding needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the chat interface THEN the system SHALL display a model selection dropdown or picker
2. WHEN the user clicks on the model selector THEN the system SHALL show available models (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude, etc.)
3. WHEN the user selects a different model THEN the system SHALL update the interface to reflect the selected model
4. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL use the currently selected model for generating responses
5. WHEN the model is changed THEN the system SHALL persist the selection for the current session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a clear conversation history with distinct message bubbles, so that I can easily follow the conversation flow and distinguish between my questions and AI responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL display it in a user message bubble with appropriate styling
2. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL display the response in a distinct AI message bubble
3. WHEN messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL show clear visual separation between user and AI messages
4. WHEN the conversation grows THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show the latest messages
5. WHEN code is included in messages THEN the system SHALL display it with proper syntax highlighting
6. WHEN the user views long conversations THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scrolling and performance optimization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want an enhanced input area with modern features, so that I can compose my messages efficiently and access additional functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user focuses on the input area THEN the system SHALL provide a clean, expandable text input
2. WHEN the user types a long message THEN the system SHALL automatically expand the input area height
3. WHEN the user wants to send a message THEN the system SHALL provide a prominent send button
4. WHEN the user has typed content THEN the system SHALL enable the send button, otherwise it SHALL be disabled
5. WHEN the user presses Enter THEN the system SHALL send the message (with Shift+Enter for new lines)
6. WHEN the user wants to attach files THEN the system SHALL provide an attachment button (for future functionality)
7. WHEN the user wants to use voice input THEN the system SHALL provide a microphone button (for future functionality)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see typing indicators and loading states, so that I know when the AI is processing my request and generating a response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL show a typing indicator while the AI is generating a response
2. WHEN the AI is streaming a response THEN the system SHALL display the text as it's being generated
3. WHEN there are network delays THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with retry options
5. WHEN the response is complete THEN the system SHALL remove all loading indicators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want quick action buttons on AI responses, so that I can easily copy code, regenerate responses, or perform other common actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI provides a response THEN the system SHALL display action buttons (copy, regenerate, like/dislike)
2. WHEN the user clicks the copy button THEN the system SHALL copy the response content to clipboard
3. WHEN the user clicks regenerate THEN the system SHALL request a new response for the same question
4. WHEN the user provides feedback THEN the system SHALL record the feedback for improvement purposes
5. WHEN the response contains code THEN the system SHALL provide a specific "copy code" button for code blocks

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to maintain the existing security verification and authentication features, so that the system remains secure while providing an improved user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security verification is required THEN the system SHALL integrate Turnstile verification seamlessly into the new design
2. WHEN the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL prompt for login with the new interface styling
3. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages consistent with the new design
4. WHEN the user completes verification THEN the system SHALL proceed with the request without disrupting the conversation flow

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to support internationalization, so that I can use the application in my preferred language (Chinese/English).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the interface THEN the system SHALL display all text in the selected language
2. WHEN the language is changed THEN the system SHALL update all interface text accordingly
3. WHEN displaying messages THEN the system SHALL maintain proper text direction and formatting for the selected language
4. WHEN showing placeholders and hints THEN the system SHALL use localized text from the existing message files
