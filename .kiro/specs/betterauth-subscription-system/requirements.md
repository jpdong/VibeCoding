# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive authentication and subscription system using BetterAuth, with Google OAuth and One-Tap login, dynamic model management, and subscription-based access control. The system will provide free and premium tiers with different model access levels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in with Google OAuth and One-Tap authentication, so that I can access the platform securely and conveniently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the site THEN the system SHALL display Google One-Tap login prompt automatically
2. WHEN the user clicks the login button in navigation THEN the system SHALL show Google OAuth login options
3. WHEN the user completes Google authentication THEN the system SHALL create or update their user profile in PostgreSQL database
4. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL store their session using BetterAuth
5. WHEN the user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect to home page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see pricing options in the navigation, so that I can understand the available subscription plans.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the navigation THEN the system SHALL display a "Pricing" link
2. WHEN the user clicks the pricing link THEN the system SHALL show free and premium plan details
3. WHEN the user views pricing THEN the system SHALL display free tier (limited models) and premium tier ($9.9/month, all models)
4. WHEN the user clicks subscribe button THEN the system SHALL show "Coming Soon" message
5. WHEN the user is logged in THEN the system SHALL show their current subscription status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select from available AI models based on my subscription, so that I can use the appropriate models for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads THEN it SHALL fetch available models from the API endpoint
2. WHEN the user views model selection THEN the system SHALL display models categorized as free or premium
3. WHEN a free user selects a premium model THEN the system SHALL prompt for login and subscription
4. WHEN a premium user selects any model THEN the system SHALL allow access without restrictions
5. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to default model list

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user data stored in PostgreSQL, so that I can manage users and subscriptions efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL store user profile in PostgreSQL users table
2. WHEN a user subscribes THEN the system SHALL create subscription record with status and expiry
3. WHEN checking user permissions THEN the system SHALL query current subscription status from database
4. WHEN user data is accessed THEN the system SHALL ensure proper data privacy and security
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my subscription status to be checked before accessing premium features, so that the system enforces proper access control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a premium model THEN the system SHALL verify their authentication status
2. WHEN a user is not logged in THEN the system SHALL prompt for login before premium access
3. WHEN a logged-in user lacks subscription THEN the system SHALL show subscription required message
4. WHEN a user has active subscription THEN the system SHALL allow full premium model access
5. WHEN subscription expires THEN the system SHALL automatically restrict access to free models

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear navigation elements for login and pricing, so that I can easily access authentication and subscription features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is not logged in THEN the navigation SHALL show "Login" button
2. WHEN the user is logged in THEN the navigation SHALL show user avatar and "Logout" option
3. WHEN the user views navigation THEN the system SHALL always show "Pricing" link
4. WHEN the user clicks pricing THEN the system SHALL navigate to pricing page
5. WHEN the user is on mobile THEN the navigation SHALL remain accessible and functional

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see "Coming Soon" message for subscription, so that I understand the feature is being developed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks any subscription/payment button THEN the system SHALL display "Coming Soon" modal
2. WHEN the coming soon modal appears THEN it SHALL include expected availability information
3. WHEN the user dismisses the modal THEN they SHALL return to the previous state
4. WHEN the user is on pricing page THEN subscription buttons SHALL be clearly marked as coming soon
5. WHEN the system shows coming soon THEN it SHALL maintain professional appearance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to integrate with existing chat interface, so that authentication and model selection work seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat interface loads THEN it SHALL use the new authentication system
2. WHEN model selection occurs THEN it SHALL respect user subscription status
3. WHEN user authentication changes THEN the chat interface SHALL update accordingly
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL include proper authentication headers
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback to users
