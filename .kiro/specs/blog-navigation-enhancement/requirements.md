# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to enhance the blog functionality by improving navigation accessibility and optimizing the display of blog articles. The enhancement includes adding proper navigation entries for the blog section and implementing conditional display logic for blog article cover images to improve the user experience when articles don't have cover images.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to easily access the blog section from the main navigation, so that I can discover and read technical articles and tutorials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page of the website THEN the main navigation SHALL display a "Blog" link that is clearly visible and accessible
2. WHEN a user clicks on the "Blog" navigation link THEN the system SHALL navigate to the blog listing page
3. WHEN a user is currently on a blog-related page THEN the "Blog" navigation link SHALL be highlighted to indicate the current section
4. WHEN viewing the navigation on mobile devices THEN the "Blog" link SHALL be included in the mobile menu with the same functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor browsing blog articles, I want to see a clean and consistent layout for articles regardless of whether they have cover images, so that the reading experience is not disrupted by missing or broken images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a blog article has a valid cover image URL THEN the system SHALL display the cover image in the article card and detail view
2. WHEN a blog article has no cover image or an empty cover image field THEN the system SHALL NOT display any image placeholder or broken image icon
3. WHEN a blog article has no cover image THEN the article layout SHALL automatically adjust to provide a clean text-only presentation
4. WHEN displaying blog articles in list view THEN articles without cover images SHALL maintain consistent spacing and alignment with articles that have cover images
5. WHEN a blog article cover image fails to load THEN the system SHALL hide the image container and adjust the layout accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the flexibility to publish blog articles with or without cover images, so that I'm not forced to create placeholder images for every article.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or editing a blog article THEN the cover image field SHALL be optional
2. WHEN a blog article is saved without a cover image THEN the system SHALL store the article successfully without requiring an image
3. WHEN displaying articles in various contexts (list, featured, related) THEN the system SHALL handle missing cover images gracefully across all display formats
4. WHEN an article without a cover image is shared on social media THEN the system SHALL use appropriate fallback metadata without relying on the cover image
